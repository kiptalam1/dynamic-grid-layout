# Dynamic grid layout

### Self Check:
 - The gap is 15px
 - The grid has two columns
 - The grid has four rows
 - The grid tracks do not use static sizes (no pixels!)
 - The second column is three times larger than the other
 - The third row is five times larger than the others
 - The columns narrow and widen as the viewport changes size
 - Row 3 gets taller to accomodate text wrapping as you narrow the viewport size
